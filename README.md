# Barriers to Skilled Maternal Healthcare in Kenya (DHS Analysis)
**Project Type:** Public Health / Data Analytics  
**Status:** In Progress ✅

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)** data to explore why some women deliver at home instead of health facilities.  
The goal is to identify key barriers to **skilled birth attendance** and provide evidence-based recommendations that can support maternal health interventions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand factors influencing **facility delivery vs. home delivery**
- Examine how **wealth, education, place of residence, antenatal care visits**, and other variables affect skilled maternal healthcare access
- Produce insights that can guide maternal health policies and resource allocation

---

## ❓ Key Questions
- Do women in urban areas access skilled delivery care more than rural women?
- How does wealth index affect likelihood of facility delivery?
- Does education level increase probability of skilled birth attendance?
- Do antenatal care (ANC) visits increase facility delivery uptake?

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** DHS (Kenya)  
**Type:** Survey dataset (women’s health, maternal services, household factors)

**Example variables:**
- Wealth index
- Education level
- Residence (Urban/Rural)
- Antenatal care visits
- Age, parity, marital status
- Place of delivery
- Skilled birth attendance indicators


## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Statistical analysis (Chi-square / Logistic Regression - optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
   - missing values, recoding categories, selecting relevant variables  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - frequency tables, group comparisons, cross-tabulation  
3. Visualization  
   - charts showing delivery patterns across groups  
4. Modeling (optional)  
   - logistic regression to estimate likelihood of facility delivery  
5. Conclusions and recommendations

## ✅ Expected Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset (or scripts)
- EDA notebook
- Visualizations showing access gaps
- Final report with recommendations
